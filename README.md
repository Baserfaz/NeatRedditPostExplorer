## Idea
The idea is simple: I wanted to create my own reddit post user interface. This React application will get posts from /r/monkslookatbeer and generate UI. It supports paging.

## TODO
This application is basically a React test and therefore is hard coded to get posts only from /r/monkslookatbeer. I might create some input field, which then manipulates the ajax call subreddit url.
