# Neat Reddit Post Explorer
Explore reddit posts in a react application.

## Idea
The idea is simple: I wanted to create my own reddit post user interface. This React application will get posts from /r/monkslookatbeer and generate UI. It supports paging.

## Use
App is deployed at https://baserfaz.github.io/NeatRedditPostExplorer/
